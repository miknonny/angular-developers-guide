filters theses are used to format the value of expression for display to the user.

underlying api is $filterprovider.


-Using filters in view templates.

filters can be applied to expressions in view templates using the following syntax.
{{ expression | filter }}

eg.
{{ 12 | currency}} formets the no 12 as a currency.using the currency filter.

also note that filters can also be chained.

{{ expression | filter | filter }};

filters can also be applied to the result of another filter. this is called chaining.
{{ expression | filter1 | filter2 }}

Filters may have arguments. the syntax for it is this.
{{ expression | filter:argument1:argument2 }}

this format the number 1234 in 2 decimal places.
{{ 1234 | number:2 }}


Using filters in controllers and services.
For this add the dependency with the name of the filter. <filterName>Filter to your
controller or service.Using the dependency numberFilter.

the below example uses a filter  called filter. this filter reduces arrays into subarrays.

this filter can be applied in a markup template like this.

{{ ctrl.array | filter:'a'}}

note that hoever using filter in a view can be costly if the array is big.
so here we call the filter direcly in the controller.
