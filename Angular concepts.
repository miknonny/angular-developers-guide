Angular concepts.

Templates - html with additional markup.
Directives - extended html custom attributes and elements.
Model - data that is shown to the user with which the user interects.


Scope - Context that the model is stored so that controllers directives and expressions can access it.

Expression - access variables and  functions from scope.

Compiler - parses the templates and instantiates directives and expression.

filter - formats the value of an expression for display to  the users.

View - what the user sees.

Databinding - sync the data between model and view.

dependency Injection - Creates and writes objects.

injector - dependency injection container.

service - reusable business logic of the view.


A little different note.

ng-init="qty=1;cost=2"
we can use ng-init to declare variables within the template.

Directives - These are so called because they apply special behaviour to attributes or elements.

Two way data binding.
When ever the input value changes, the value of the expression is automatically calculated. and the dom is updated with the values.


Makr sure to look at the angular conceptual overview to understand services better.
