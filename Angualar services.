Angualar services.

thses are singleton objects that carry out tasks common to webapps.
eg. $http service. this provides access to browser XMLHttpRequest object.

Like with other identifier the built in service always start wtih $http.


Using a Service.
To use an angular service you identify it as a dependency for the component.
(controller service filter or directive).

note that the angular service depends on  the on the contructor patttern.

The dependency is passed into components factory constructor function.

using angular services.

myModule.factory('myService', ['$http', myserive function])

the purpose of the  service factory function is to generate a single object or function that represents the service.

Note that angular factory functions are executed lazily. they are only executed when they are need to satisfy tha dependency.

Every thig that is dependent on the object gets a reference to to the single instance.
